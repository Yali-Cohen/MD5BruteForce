# MD5 Brute Force

A simple Python script to perform a brute force attack on an MD5 hashed password.

## Description

This project demonstrates a brute force attack to find the original password that matches a given MD5 hash. The script iterates through a range of numbers and hashes each number to check if it matches the target hash. If a match is found, the script prints the original password.

## Usage

To use the script, simply run it with Python:

```bash
python md5_bruteforce.py
